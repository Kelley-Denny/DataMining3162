# DataMining3162
This is my repo for my ITSC 3162 (data mining) projects for fall semester 2024.

Welcome to the repository for my Data Mining course projects! This repository contains several projects and assignments completed as part of my college coursework, demonstrating various data mining techniques and concepts.

About the Projects
This repository showcases a collection of projects that I completed as part of my Data Mining course. Each project explores different algorithms, methods, and techniques related to extracting useful insights and patterns from large datasets.

Some of the topics covered in the projects include:

    Supervised Learning (Classification, Regression)
    Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Association Rule Mining)
    Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction
    Data Preprocessing (Cleaning, Transformation)
    Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

The primary goal of these projects is to gain a solid understanding of how data mining techniques work and how they can be applied to real-world problems.


Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Libraries/Frameworks:

    pandas for data manipulation
    numpy for numerical operations
    scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
    matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization


Project List
1. Project 1 - Data prepocessing and Exploration
   Description: Prepocessed raw data by handling missing and duplicate values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing/standardizing data. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
   See Data Mining Project 1.ipynb
2. Project 2 - Classification Machine Learning
   Description: Preprocessed raw data by handling missing and duplicate values, scaling data, and applying SMOTE to class imbalance. Applied Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier models and evaluated the performance with Accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices.
